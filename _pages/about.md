In a broad sense, I'm interested in how nature solves optimality problems, mostly with regard to dynamics and locomotion. In particular I'm interested in how to design controllers that can effectively exploit natural dynamics and, perhaps more importantly, how to design the natural dynamics themselves (i.e. the mechanical system) such that exploiting them becomes simpler and almost automatic. In other words, my focus is on understanding the coupling between morphology and control.

I'm currently a postdoc in the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab at MIT](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/).
I completed my Bsc and Msc at ETH Zurich, starting in Mechanical Engineering and then specializing in Robotics, Systems and Control. During this time I spent a semester at TU Delft, and finished my master thesis at BioRob at EPFL working on how tails can be used in legged locomotion. Before joining the Dynamic Locomotion Group at Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, I spent a couple years in Ishiguro Lab at Tohoku University in Japan.

Outside the lab I enjoy photography, cooking, music and games, in particular go. If you ever want to discuss things (research-related or not) feel free to drop me an e-mail at: heim.steve@gmail.com

I strongly recommend [**Picture a Scientist**](https://www.pictureascientist.com/), especially if you're in academia. The documentary not only covers an important, timely topic (gender inequality in academia), the coverage is thorough, the narrative is engaging, and the cinematography is also quite beautiful; there were actual scenes where I had conflicting feelings of "this is horrible (what is happening)" and "this is beautiful (the scene composition)".  

I want to talk about one aspect.

Motivation to come forward. For most victims, it is not in your interest. What triggered her decision is not getting tenure, it is not safety from repurcussions: it is external. Her daughter.

 The lesson we should learn is that providing tools to victims is not a solution: it is almost never in the victim's interest to come forward, no matter how many tools they are given.
